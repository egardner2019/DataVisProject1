# Health in the USA
This is my first project for my data visualization course at the University of Cincinnati (CS6024).
More information about this project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/egardner2019/UC/CS6024/project-1.
Additionally, the code for this project is deployed at https://data-vis-project-1.netlify.app/.

This project was created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

To run this code, I used the Live Preview Extension by Microsoft within Visual Studio Code. Simply download the extension, right-click on index.html, and choose the "Show Preview" option.
